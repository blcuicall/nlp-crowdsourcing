President O
Bill B-PER
Clinton I-PER
has O
served O
notice O
he O
intends O
to O
be O
busy O
making O
news O
-- O
or O
at O
least O
doing O
things O
that O
look O
and O
sound O
like O
it O
in O
a O
campaign O
year O
. O

With O
Democrats B-MISC
gathering O
in O
Chicago B-LOC
to O
start O
a O
convention O
on O
Monday O
to O
nominate O
him O
for O
a O
second O
term O
as O
president O
, O
Clinton B-PER
plans O
a O
steady O
parade O
of O
events O
designed O
to O
highlight O
his O
leadership O
and O
dim O
the O
glow O
of O
the O
just-concluded O
Republican B-MISC
conclave O
that O
gave O
a O
boost O
to O
rival O
Bob B-PER
Dole I-PER
. O

After O
a O
week O
of O
carefully O
orchestrated O
events O
signing O
into O
law O
bills O
passed O
by O
the O
Republican-controlled B-MISC
Congress B-ORG
, O
Clinton B-PER
used O
his O
Saturday O
radio O
address O
to O
the O
nation O
to O
proudly O
announce O
a O
development O
in O
the O
war O
on O
crime O
. O

Sixty O
days O
ago O
I O
directed O
the O
attorney O
general O
to O
draw O
up O
a O
plan O
for O
a O
national O
registry O
of O
sex O
offenders O
, O
Clinton B-PER
said O
. O

That O
plan O
has O
now O
reached O
my O
desk O
. O

Today O
I O
am O
pleased O
to O
announce O
that O
we O
are O
following O
through O
on O
our O
commitment O
to O
keep O
track O
of O
these O
criminals O
, O
not O
just O
in O
a O
single O
state O
but O
wherever O
they O
go O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Actually O
, O
creation O
of O
such O
a O
registry O
was O
underway O
without O
Clinton B-PER
lifting O
a O
finger O
. O

Attorney O
General O
Janet B-PER
Reno I-PER
's O
report O
-- O
all O
nine O
pages O
of O
it O
, O
including O
footnotes O
-- O
offers O
only O
the O
interim O
services O
of O
the O
FBI B-ORG
until O
a O
formal O
registry O
on O
sex O
offenders O
has O
been O
established O
. O

Two O
months O
ago O
, O
Clinton B-PER
announced O
he O
wanted O
an O
interim O
effort O
established O
. O

Now O
, O
60 O
days O
later O
, O
he O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
again O
. O

It O
is O
an O
example O
of O
Clinton B-PER
's O
strategic O
planning O
as O
he O
heads O
into O
the O
stretch O
drive O
for O
the O
Nov. O
5 O
presidential O
election O
. O

Such O
things O
do O
not O
happen O
by O
chance O
in O
the O
Clinton B-PER
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
, O
they O
are O
part O
of O
his O
political O
chess O
game O
. O

In O
the O
past O
week O
Clinton B-PER
signed O
into O
law O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
minimium O
wage O
, O
a O
bill O
that O
makes O
it O
easier O
for O
someone O
with O
a O
pre-existing O
health O
problem O
to O
change O
jobs O
, O
and O
sweeping O
changes O
overhauling O
the O
nation O
's O
welfare O
system O
. O

America B-LOC
can O
look O
back O
on O
a O
week O
of O
remarkable O
achievement O
, O
Clinton B-PER
said O
, O
without O
even O
a O
passing O
reference O
to O
the O
Republican B-MISC
majority O
in O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
Senate B-ORG
. O

America B-LOC
is O
on O
the O
right O
track O
offering O
more O
opportunity O
, O
demanding O
more O
responsibility O
, O
building O
a O
stronger O
community O
, O
the O
sense O
of O
shared O
values O
and O
stronger O
families O
, O
he O
said O
in O
striking O
the O
theme O
of O
his O
coming O
week O
. O

According O
to O
a O
senior O
campaign O
official O
, O
Clinton B-PER
will O
be O
making O
a O
lot O
of O
news O
in O
the O
coming O
week O
-- O
something O
different O
each O
day O
. O

Clinton B-PER
departs O
on O
Sunday O
on O
a O
four-day O
train O
trip O
through O
West B-LOC
Virginia I-LOC
, O
Kentucky B-LOC
, O
Ohio B-LOC
, O
Michigan B-LOC
and O
Indiana B-LOC
while O
fellow O
Democrats B-MISC
are O
gathered O
in O
Chicago B-LOC
. O

He O
'll O
make O
news O
during O
the O
day O
... O
and O
then O
at O
night O
the O
attention O
will O
go O
to O
the O
convention O
, O
said O
the O
campaign O
official O
. O

We O
think O
it O
'll O
work O
really O
well O
. O

Although O
officials O
decline O
to O
say O
just O
what O
each O
day O
's O
news O
will O
be O
, O
the O
intent O
is O
to O
put O
a O
focus O
on O
Clinton B-PER
himself O
and O
not O
just O
those O
attending O
the O
party O
's O
convention O
. O

Each O
day O
of O
the O
trip O
will O
have O
a O
late O
start O
, O
so O
that O
network O
television O
correspondents O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
live O
reports O
for O
morning O
programmes O
. O

Campaign O
officials O
then O
hope O
the O
day O
's O
news O
event O
will O
be O
showcased O
on O
evening O
television O
news O
shows O
as O
a O
lead-in O
for O
that O
night O
's O
convention O
programme O
. O

We O
'll O
be O
concentrating O
... O
on O
supporting O
the O
president O
as O
he O
is O
on O
the O
trip O
and O
making O
significant O
public O
policy O
statements O
related O
to O
some O
of O
his O
plans O
for O
the O
future O
