with O
German B-MISC

should O
buy O
sheepmeat O
from O
countries O
other O
than O
Britain B-LOC
until O
the O
scientific O
advice O
was O
clearer O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
support O
any O
such O
recommendation O
because O
we O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
grounds O
for O
it O
, O
the O
Commission B-ORG
's O
chief O

Nikolaus B-PER

told O
a O
news O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O
was O
required O
and O
if O
it O
was O
found O
that O
action O
was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O
month O
by O
EU B-ORG
Farm O
Commissioner O
Franz B-PER
Fischler I-PER
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O
cords O
from O
the O
human O
and O
animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler B-PER
proposed O
EU-wide B-MISC
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain B-LOC
and O
France B-LOC
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep O
could O
contract O
Bovine B-MISC
Spongiform I-MISC

( O
BSE B-MISC

-- O
mad O

the O
EU B-ORG

standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O
officials O
, O
questioned O
if O
such O
action O
was O
justified O
as O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slight O
risk O
to O
human O
health O
. O

The O
EU B-ORG

expressed O
concern O
