Israel B-LOC
's O
outgoing O
peace O
negotiator O
with O
Syria B-LOC
said O
on O
Thursday O
current O
tensions O
between O
the O
two O
countries O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
storm O
in O
a O
teacup O
. O

Itamar B-PER
Rabinovich I-PER
, O
who O
as O
Israel B-LOC
's O
ambassador O
to O
Washington B-LOC
conducted O
unfruitful O
negotiations O
with O
Syria B-LOC
, O
told O
Israel B-ORG
Radio I-ORG
it O
looked O
like O
Damascus B-LOC
wanted O
to O
talk O
rather O
than O
fight O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
me O
the O
Syrian B-MISC
priority O
is O
still O
to O
negotiate O
. O

The O
Syrians B-MISC
are O
confused O
, O
they O
are O
definitely O
tense O
, O
but O
the O
general O
assessment O
here O
in O
Washington B-LOC
is O
that O
this O
is O
essentially O
a O
storm O
in O
a O
teacup O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Rabinovich B-PER
is O
winding O
up O
his O
term O
as O
ambassador O
. O

He O
will O
be O
replaced O
by O
Eliahu B-PER
Ben-Elissar I-PER
, O
a O
former O
Israeli B-MISC
envoy O
to O
Egypt B-LOC
and O
right-wing O
Likud B-ORG
party O
politician O
. O

Israel B-LOC
on O
Wednesday O
sent O
Syria B-LOC
a O
message O
, O
via O
Washington B-LOC
, O
saying O
it O
was O
committed O
to O
peace O
and O
wanted O
to O
open O
negotiations O
without O
preconditions O
. O

But O
it O
slammed O
Damascus B-LOC
for O
creating O
what O
it O
called O
a O
dangerous O
atmosphere O
. O

Syria B-LOC
accused O
Israel B-LOC
on O
Wednesday O
of O
launching O
a O
hysterical O
campaign O
against O
it O
after O
Israeli B-MISC
television O
reported O
that O
Damascus B-LOC
had O
recently O
test O
fired O
a O
missile O
. O

It O
said O
its O
arms O
purchases O
were O
for O
defensive O
purposes O
. O

The O
message O
that O
we O
sent O
to O
( O
Syrian B-MISC
President O
Hafez B-PER
al- I-PER
) O
Assad B-PER
is O
that O
Israel B-LOC
is O
ready O
at O
any O
time O
without O
preconditions O
to O
enter O
peace O
negotiations O
, O
Israeli B-MISC
Foreign O
Minister O
David B-PER
Levy I-PER
told O
Israel B-ORG
Radio I-ORG
in O
an O
interview O
. O

Tension O
has O
mounted O
since O
Israeli B-MISC
Prime O
Minister O
Benjamin B-PER
Netanyahu I-PER
took O
office O
in O
June O
vowing O
to O
retain O
the O
Golan B-LOC
Heights I-LOC
Israel/B-LOC O
captured O
from O
Syria B-LOC
in O
the O
1967 O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
war O
. O

Israeli-Syrian B-MISC
peace O
talks O
have O
been O
deadlocked O
over O
the O
Golan B-LOC
since O
1991 O
despite O
the O
previous O
government O
's O
willingness O
to O
make O
Golan B-LOC
concessions O
. O

Peace O
talks O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
were O
last O
held O
in O
February O
. O

The O
voices O
coming O
out O
of O
Damascus B-LOC
are O
bad O
, O
not O
good O
. O

The O
media O
... O

are O
full O
of O
expressions O
and O
declarations O
that O
must O
be O
worrying O
... O

this O
artificial O
atmosphere O
is O
very O
dangerous O
because O
those O
who O
spread O
it O
could O
become O
its O
prisoners O
, O
Levy B-PER
said O
. O

We O
expect O
from O
Syria B-LOC
, O
if O
its O
face O
is O
to O
peace O
, O
that O
it O
will O
answer O
Israel B-LOC
's O
message O
to O
enter O
peace O
negotiations O
because O
that O
is O
our O
goal O
, O
he O
said O
. O

We O
do O
not O
want O
a O
war O
, O
God B-PER
forbid O
. O

No O
one O
benefits O
from O
wars O
. O

Israel B-LOC
's O
Channel B-ORG
Two I-ORG
television O
said O
Damascus B-LOC
had O
sent O
a O
calming O
signal O
to O
Israel B-LOC
. O

It O
gave O
no O
source O
for O
the O
report O
. O

Netanyahu B-PER
and O
Levy B-PER
's O
spokesmen O
said O
they O
could O
not O
confirm O
it O
. O

The O
television O
also O
said O
that O
Netanyahu B-PER
had O
sent O
messages O
to O
reassure O
