consumers O
should O
buy O
sheepmeat O
from O
countries O
other O
than O
Britain O
until O
the O
scientific O
advice O
was O
clearer O
. O

We O
do O

support O
any O

because O
we O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
grounds O
for O
it O
, O
the O
Commission O

chief O

Nikolaus B-PER

told O
a O
news O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O
was O
required O
and O
if O
it O
was O
found O
that O
action O
was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
Europe B-LOC
an O
Union O
. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O
month O
by O
EU O
Farm O
Commissioner O
Franz B-PER
Fischler I-PER
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O
cords O
from O
the O
human O
and O
animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler O
proposed O
EU-wide O
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain B-LOC
and I-LOC
France I-LOC
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep O
could O
contract O
Bovine O
Spongiform O
Encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O
) O
-- O
mad O
cow O
disease O
. O

But O
Fischler O
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU O
's O
standing O
veterinary B-MISC
committee I-MISC
, O
mational O
animal O
health O
officials O
, O
questioned O
if O
such O
action O
was O
justified O
as O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slight O
risk O
to O
human O
health O
. O

Spanish O
Farm O
Minister O
Loyola O
de O
Palacio O
had O
earlier O
accused O
Fischler O
at O

' O
meeting O
of O
causing O
unjustified O
alarm O
through O
dangerous O
generalisation O

. O

Only O
France O

backed O
Fischler O

The O
EU O

scientific O

multidisciplinary O
committees O
are O
due O
to O
re-examine O
the O
issue O
early O

recommendations O
to O
the O
senior O

Sheep O

long O

known O

contract O

denied O
on O
Thursday O
there O
was O
any O
danger O
to O
human O

, O
but O
expressed O
concern O
that O

government O
advice O

to O
avoid O
British B-MISC

influence O
consumers O

What O
