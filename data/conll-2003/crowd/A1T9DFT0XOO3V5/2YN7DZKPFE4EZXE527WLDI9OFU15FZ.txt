customs O

said O
on O
Friday O
. O

We O
have O
always O
been O
concerned O
about O
barter O
deals O
with O
other O
countries O
, O
viewing O
them O
as O
a O
disguised O
kind O
of O
capital O
flight O

Russia B-LOC
, O
Marina B-PER
Volkova I-PER
, O
deputy O
head O
of O
the O
currency B-ORG

State B-MISC

Volkova O
said O
last O
year O
goods O
had O
been O
exported O
under O
many O
Russia B-LOC
n O
barter O
deals O
, O
with O
nothing O
imported O
in O
return O
. O

She O
said O
the O
cost O
of O
such O
unimported O
goods O
was O
$ O
1.10 O
billion O
in O
1995 O
. O

Barter O
deals O
were O
worth O
$ O
4.9 O
billion O
last O
year O
, O
or O
about O
eight O
percent O
of O
all O
Russia B-LOC
n O
exports O
estimated O
at O
$ O
61.5 O
billion O
, O
she O
said O
. O

The O
cost O
of O
exported O
goods O
is O
too O
often O
understated O
, O
so O
the O
actual O
share O
of O
barter O
deals O
in O
Russia B-LOC
n O
exports O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
unimported O
goods O
may O
be O
even O
higher O
, O
Volkova O
said O
. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
Russia B-LOC
n O
President O
Boris B-PER
Yeltsin I-PER
issued O
a O
decree O
on O
state O
regulation O
of O
foreign O
barter O
deals O
, O
and O
Volkova O
said O
this O
could O
substantially O
improve O
the O
situation O
. O

In O
line O
with O
the O
decree O
, O
which O
will O
come O
into O
force O
on O
November O
1 O
, O
all O
Russia B-LOC
n O
barter O
traders O
will O
be O
obliged O
to O
import O
goods O
worth O
the O
cost O
of O
their O
exports O
within O
180 O
days O
. O

If O
traders O
are O
late O
, O
they O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
fines O
worth O
the O
cost O
of O
their O
exported O
goods O
, O
Volkova O
said O
. O

Understating O
the O
cost O
of O
exported O
goods O
could O
still O
be O
a O
loophole O
for O
barter O
dealers O
, O
but O
Volkova O
said O
the O
authorities O
are O
currently O
tackling O
the O
technicalities O
of O
the O
issue O
. O

Barter O
has O
always O
been O
a O
feature O
of O
the O
Soviet B-LOC
Union I-LOC
's O
foreign O
trade O
, O
but O
Yeltsin O
's O
decrees O
liberalising O
foreign O
trade O
in O
1991-1992 O
has O
given O
barter O
a O
new O
impetus O
. O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
barter O
deals O
accounted O
for O
up O
to O
25-30 O
percent O
of O
Russia B-LOC
n O
exports O
because O
thousands O
( O
of O
) O
trade O
companies O
which O
popped O
up O
preferred O
barter O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
reliable O
Russia B-LOC
n O
banks O
and O
money O
transfer O
systems O
, O
Volkova O
said O
. O

Now O
many O
Russia B-LOC
n O
banks O
are O
strong O
and O
can O
make O
various O
sorts O
of O
money O
tranfers O
, O
while O
incompetent O
traders O
are O
being O
ousted O
by O
more O
experienced O
ones O
. O

But O
the O
current O
share O
of O
barter O
deals O
in O
Russia B-LOC
n O
exports O
is O
still O
high O
