sentence O

distributing O
neo-Nazi B-PER
material O
is O
illegal O
in O

Lauck B-PER
's O
defence O
team O
had O
argued O
that O
U.S O
freedom O
of O

meant O
he O
was O
free O
to O
produce O
his O
swastika-covered O

Interior O

Manfred B-PER
Kanther I-PER
said O
in O
a O
statement O
he O
welcomed O
the O
prosecution O
and O
conviction O
of O
one O
of O
the O
ringleaders O
of O

Lauck B-PER

dressed O
in O
a O

sporting O
his O
trademark O
Hitleresque O
black O
moustache O

showed O
no O
sign O

Bertram O

more O
than O
an O
hour O
reading O
out O
the O
verdict O
and O
explaining O
the O
court O

decision O

But O
as O
Lauck B-PER
was O
about O
to O
be O
led O
away O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
reporters O
and O
blurted O
out O
a O
virtually O
incomprehensible O
quick-fire O
diatribe O
against O
the O
court O
. O

Neither O
the O
National O
Socialists O
( O
Nazis O
) O
nor O
the O
communists O
dared O
to O
kidnap O
an O
American O
citizen O
, O
he O
shouted O
, O
in O
an O
oblique O
reference O
to O
his O
extradition O
to O
German B-MISC
y B-LOC
from O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

That O
's O
the O
truth O
. O

His O
attorney O
, O
Hans-Otto O
Sieg O
, O
told O
reporters O
outside O
the O
courtroom O
that O
the O
judges O
had O
not O
explained O
how O
a O
German B-MISC
court O
could O
judge O
someone O
for O
actions O
carried O
out O
in O
the O
United B-LOC

Bertram O
said O
Lauck B-PER
was O
obsessed O
by O
Nazism B-MISC
and O
devoted O
his O
life O
to O
leading O
his O
National O
Socialist O
German B-MISC
Workers O
' O
Party O
Foreign O
Organisation O
( O
NSDAP-AO O
) O
, O
which O
derives O
its O
name O
from O
the O
full O
German B-MISC
title O
of O
Hitler O
's O
Nazi O
party O
. O

During O
the O
three-month O
trial O
, O
the O
court O
dealt O
mainly O
with O
issues O
of O
the O
NSDAP-AO O
's O
NS O
Kampfruf O
( O
National O
Socialist O
Battle O
Cry O
) O
magazine O
, O
filled O
with O
references O
to O
Aryan O
supremacy O
and O
defamatory O
statements O
about O
Jews O
. O

The O
court O
rejected O
Sieg O
's O
argument O
that O
Lauck B-PER
's O
extradition O
from O
Denmark B-LOC
, O
where O
he O
was O
arrested O
in O
March O
last O
year O
at O
the O
request O
of O
German B-MISC
authorities O
, O
was O
illegal O
. O

Lauck B-PER
was O
also O
convicted O
of O
disseminating O
the O
symbols O
of O
anti-constitutional O
organisations O
. O

He O
will O
probably O
be O
free O
in O
around O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

The O
court O
ruled O
that O
the O
15 O
months O
he O
has O
spent O
in O
custody O
since O
his O
arrest O
should O
be O
subtracted O
from O
his O
prison O
term O
