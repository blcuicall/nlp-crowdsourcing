If O
you O
really O
look O
at O
the O
match O
, O
said O
the O
12th-ranked O
Washington B-ORG
after I-ORG
losing I-ORG
to I-ORG
the I-ORG
70th-ranked I-ORG
Rafter I-ORG
, O
I O
never O
really O
got O
a O
chance O
to O
play O
because O
he O
was O
serving O
big O
and O
getting O
in O
close O
to O
the O
net O
. O

He O
was O
also O
able O
to O
handle O
my O
serve O
pretty O
easily O
because O
my O
( O
first O
) O
service O
percentage O
was O
only O
in O
the O
40s O
. O

Put O
those O
two O
things O
together O
and O
you O
get O
a O
loss O
. O

Rafter O
missed O
10 O
weeks O
after O
wrist O
surgery O
earlier O
this O
year O
and O
the O
time O
away O
from O
tennis B-MISC
has O
given O
him O
a O
new O
perspective O
. O

Before O
when O
I O
was O
on O
tour O
, O
I O
always O
felt O
I O
had O
to O
be O
in O
bed O
by O
9:30 O
or O
10 O
o'clock O
and O
I O
had O
to O
be O
up O
at O
a O
certain O
time O
, O
Rafter O
said O
. O

Now O
I O
can O
go O
to O
bed O
at O
at O
midnight O
or O
wake O
up O
at O
seven O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
have O
as O
many O
set O
routines O
and O
it O
's O
made O
me O
a O
happier O
person O
. O

Martin B-PER
was O
pleased O
with O
his O
victory O
over O
Pioline O
, O
his O
first O
in O
five O
meetings O
with O
the O
11th-ranked O
Frenchman O
. O

It O
's O
always O
difficult O
to O
win O
a O
match O
when O
you O
lose O
the O
first O
set O
, O
especially O
against O
someone O
you O
have O
never O
beaten O
, O
he O
said O
. O

I O
got O
more O
aggressive O
in O
the O
second O
and O
third O
sets O
and O
the O
wind O
picked O
up O
and O
that O
also O
affected O
things O
because O
Cedric O
definitely O
went O
off O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

The O
26-year-old O
O'Brien B-PER
, O
who O
won O
the O
ATP O
Tour O
stop O
in O
New O
Haven O
last O
week O
, O
has O
now O
won O
18 O
of O
his O
last O
20 O
matches O
, O
dating O
back O
to O
qualifying O
rounds O
in O
Los O
Angeles O
in O
late O
July O
. O

He O
ranks O
76th O
after O
being O
285th O
four O
weeks O
ago O
. O

I O
feel O
I O
'm O
hitting O
the O
ball O
well O
even O
though O
I O
'm O
having O
more O
mental O
letdowns O
than O
I O
did O
last O
week O
, O
O'Brien B-PER
said O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
still O
competing O
well O
. O

I O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
first O
serves O
in O
, O
said O
Enqvist B-PER
about O
his O
victory O
over O
Korda O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
miss O
that O
many O
shots O
and O
he O
was O
making O
the O
mistakes O
. O

Still O
marvelling O
at O
an O
exciting O
64-stroke O
rally O
he O
won O
in O
the O
last O
game O
of O
his O
second-round O
match O
against O
Javier O
Sanchez O
of O
Spain O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
Enqvist B-PER
joked O
, O
Today O
against O
Petr O
there O
were O
about O
64 O
strokes O
in O
the O
whole O
match O
. O

It O
was O
mostly O
short O
points O
