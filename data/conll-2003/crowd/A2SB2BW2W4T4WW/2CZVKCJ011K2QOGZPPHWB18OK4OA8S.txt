For O
the O
first O
time O
in O
Israel B-LOC
i O
history O
, O
an O
Arab B-MISC
team O
will O
take O
the O
field O
when O
the O
National B-MISC

starts O

four O
Jewish B-MISC
players O
and O
two O
foreign O

a O
Pole B-MISC

a O
Romanian B-MISC

The O
rest O
of O
the O
side O
is O
made O
up O
mainly O
of O
Moslem B-MISC
Arab B-MISC

The O
club O
, O
founded O
in O
1961 O
, O
has O
a O
loyal O
following O
in O
Taibe B-ORG

an O
Arab B-MISC

the O
heart O
of O
Israel B-LOC

But O
away O
from O
their O
home O
ground O
, O
they O
face O
unfriendly O
crowds O
who O
taunt O
the O
players O
with O
racist O
abuse O
. O

The O
very O
first O
thing O
we O
thought O
about O
after O
we O
knew O
we O
would O
be O
promoted O
was O
the O
game O
against O

closely O
associated O

the O

party O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
Cup B-MISC

Chants O
from O
the O
crowd O
of O
Death O
to O
the O
Arab B-MISC
s O
, O
and O
bottle-throwing O
during O
the O
game O
marred O
the O
match O
which O
ended O
in O
a O
goalless O

One O
Taibe B-ORG

 B-LOC
supporter O
required O
hospital O
treatment O
for O
cuts O
and O
bruises O
after O
a O
stone O
struck O
his O
head O
as O
he O
was O
driving O
from O
the O
stadium O

We O
're O
used O
to O
hearing O
the O
taunts O
of O
Death O

the O

But O
we O
know O
that O
these O
are O
only O
words O
, O
nobody O
has O
died O
from O
hearing O
them O
and O
it O
only O
makes O
us O
support O
our O
team O
more O
vehemently O
. O

The O
dusty O
town O
of O
Taibe B-ORG
 B-LOC
 B-LOC
lacks O
the O
amenities O
of O
Jewish B-MISC
communities O
and O
many O
Israel B-LOC
i O
Arab B-MISC
s O
have O
long O
complained O
of O
state O
discrimination O
. O

There O
are O
no O
parks O
or O
empty O
areas O
of O
land O
around O
here O
, O
so O
when O
we O
want O
to O
play O
a O
friendly O
game O
of O
soccer O
we O
all O
load O
up O
in O
the O
car O

travel O

ramshackle O
2,500-seat O

We O
plan O
to O
