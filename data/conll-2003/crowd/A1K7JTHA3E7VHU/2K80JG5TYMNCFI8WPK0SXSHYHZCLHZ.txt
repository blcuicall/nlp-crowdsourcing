Vacek I-PER

I O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
serve O
well O
and O
keep O
the O
points O
short O
and O
that O
's O
what O
I O
was O
able O
to O
do O
, O

There O

Canadian O
broke O
Muster O
at O

first O
set O
and O
5-5 O
in O
the O
second O
before O
ending O
the O
match O
on O
his O
third O
match O
point O
when O
the O
Austria B-LOC
n O
hit O
a O
service O
return O
long O
. O

I O
probably O
did O
n't O
hit O
five O
ground O
strokes O
in O
the O
whole O
match O
, O
said O
Muster O
, O
only O
partly O
joking O
. O

The O
way O
he O
was O
chipping O
and O
charging O
and O
serving O
and O
volleying O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
my O
timing O
playing O
from O
the O
baseline O
. O

He O
played O
a O
good O
match O
, O
took O
a O
few O
chances O
, O
and O
every O
time O
he O
was O
down O
he O
was O
able O
to O
come O
up O
with O
a O
big O
first O
serve O
. O

Playing O
at O
night O
was O
not O
Muster O
's O
preference O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
day O
match O
and O
they O
gave O
me O
a O
night O
match O
, O
he O
said O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
playing O
under O
the O
lights O
but O
maybe O
it O
would O
not O
have O
made O
any O
difference O
. O

Ivanisevic O
rallied O
from O
a O
2-5 O
deficit O
in O
the O
first O
set O
but O
then O
played O
erratically O
against O
the O
44th-ranked O
Tillstrom O
, O
who O
was O
a O
surprise O
winner O
over O
his O
famous O
compatriot O
Stefan B-PER
Edberg I-PER
in O
the O
second O
round O
at O
Wimbledon B-LOC
. O

Ivanisevic O
hit O
32 O
aces O
but O
was O
outplayed O
from O
the O
back O
court O
by O
the O
24-year-old O
Tillstrom O
. O

The O
sixth-ranked O
Ivanisevic O
, O
who O
lost O
in O
the O
final O
at O
Indianapolis B-LOC
to O
world O
number O
one O
Pete B-PER
Sampras I-PER
of O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
last O
Sunday O
, O
made O
a O
quick O
getaway O
after O
his O
loss O
but O
did O
say O
: O
Something O
was O
not O
there O
when O
I O
arrived O
( O
in O
Toronto B-PER
) O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
feel O
good O
. O

And O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
good O
feeling O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
lost O
in O
my O
doubles O
( O
on O
Tuesday O
) O
. O

I O
thought O
he O
looked O
a O
little O
unfocused O
at O
certain O
times O
on O
his O
ground O
strokes O
, O
said O
Tillstrom O
. O

The O
19-year-old O
Philippoussis O
, O
who O
beat O
Sampras O
in O
the O
third O
round O
of O
this O
year O
's O
Australia B-LOC
n O
Open O
, O
stayed O
calm O
in O
a O
nervy O
third-set O
tie O
break O
against O
Rosset O
. O

I O
'm O
pleased O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
play O
that O
great O
today O
, O
but O
I O
fought O
really O
well O
, O
he O
said O
. O

When O
I O
was O
down O
2-5 O
in O
the O
tiebreak O
( O
in O
the O
third O
set O
) O
, O
I O
just O
thought O
about O
winning O
my O
two O
serves O
and O
hoped O
that O
he O
might O
get O
tight O
. O

Then O
he O
shanked O
a O
forehand O
at O
to O
make O
it O
5-all O
and O
that O
helped O
me O
back O
. O
