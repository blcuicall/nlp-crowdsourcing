For O
the O
first O
time O
in O
Israeli O
history O
, O
an O
Arab O
team O
will O
take O
the O
field O
when O
the O
National O
League O
soccer O
season O
starts O
on O
Saturday O
. O

Hapoel O
Taibe O
fields O
four O
Jewish O
players O
and O
two O
foreign O
imports O
-- O
a O
Pole O
and O
a O
Romanian B-MISC
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
side O
is O
made O
up O
mainly O
of O
Moslem O
Arabs I-MISC
. O

The O
club O
, O
founded O
in O
1961 O
, O
has O
a O
loyal O
following O
in O
Taibe/LOC O
, O
an O
Arab O
town O
of O
28,000 O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Israel/LOC B-LOC
. O

But O
away O
from O
their O
home O
ground O
, O
they O
face O
unfriendly O
crowds O
who O
taunt O
the O
players O
with O
racist O
abuse O
. O

The O
very O
first O
thing O
we O
thought O
about O
after O
we O
knew O
we O
would O
be O
promoted O
was O
the O
game O
against O
Betar O
Jerusalem O
, O
said O
Taibe O
supporter O
Karem O
Haj I-PER
Yihye O
. O

Two O
weeks O
ago O
Taibe B-ORG
, O
coached O
by O
Pole O
Wojtek O
Lazarek O
, O
met O
Betar O
, O
a O
club O
closely O
associated O
with O
the O
right-wing O
Likud O
party O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
Cup O
match O
in O
Jerusalem/LOC O
. O

Chants O
from O
the O
crowd O
of O
Death O
to O
the O
Arabs O
, O
and O
bottle-throwing O
during O
the O
game O
marred O
the O
match O
which O
ended O
in O
a O
goalless O
draw O
. O

One O
Taibe B-ORG
supporter O
required O
hospital O
treatment O
for O
cuts O
and O
bruises O
after O
a O
stone O
struck O
his O
head O
as O
he O
was O
driving O
from O
the O
stadium O
. O

We O
're O
used O
to O
hearing O
the O
taunts O
of O
Death O
to O
the O
Arabs O
' O
, O
said O
Sameh B-PER
Haj I-PER
Yihye I-PER
, O
a O
Taibe/LOC O
resident O
who O
studies O
at O
Jerusalem/LOC O
's O
Hebrew O
University O
. O

But O
we O
know O
that O
these O
are O
only O
words O
, O
nobody O
has O
died O
from O
hearing O
them O
and O
it O
only O
makes O
us O
support O
our O
team O
more O
vehemently O
. O

The O
dusty O
town O
of O
Taibe/LOC O
lacks O
the O
amenities O
of O
Jewish O
communities O
and O
many O
Israeli O
Arabs O
have O
long O
complained O
of O
state O
discrimination O
. O

There O
are O
no O
parks O
or O
empty O
areas O
of O
land O
around O
here O
, O
so O
when O
we O
want O
to O
play O
a O
friendly O
game O
of O
soccer O
we O
all O
load O
up O
in O
the O
car O
and O
travel O
to O
Tel/LOC O
Aviv/LOC O
, O
60 O
km O
( O
36 O
miles O
) O
away O
, O
Sameh O
Haj O
Yihye O
said O
. O

The O
town O
's O
ramshackle O
2,500-seat O
ground O
is O
accessible O
only O
by O
two O
dirt O
tracks O
. O

We O
plan O
to O
build O
a O
10,000-seat O
stadium O
, O
but O
it O
may O
well O
be O
situated O
elsewhere O
, O
said O
club O
chairman O
Abdul O
Rahman O
Haj O
Yihye O
. O

We O
will O
discuss O
this O
with O
the O
mayor O
and O
hopefully O
a O
new O
or O
refurbished O
ground O
will O
be O
completed O
by O
the O
start O
of O
the O
new O
year O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
Taibe O
will O
play O
all O
their O
heavily O
policed O
home O
matches O
at O
the O
Jewish O
coastal O
town O
of O
Netanya/LOC O
. O

We O
are O
Israelis O
, O
there O
is O
no O
question O
about O
that O
, O
said O
Karem O
Haj O
Yihye O
, O
a O
hotel O
waiter O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
connection O
with O
the O
Palestinians O
, O
they O
live O
over O
there O
, O
he O
said O
, O
pointing O
to O
the O
West/LOC O
Bank/LOC O
seven O
km O
( O
four O
miles O
) O
to O
the O
east O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
feel O
our O
club O
represents O
Palestinian O
Arabs O
, O
said O
club O
chairman O
Abdul O
Rahman O
. O

We O
are O
trying O
to O
do O
all O
we O
can O
to O
run O
a O
professional O
outfit O
, O
we O
are O
pleased O
at O
any O
support O
we O
get O
, O
but O
do O
not O
go O
out O
looking O
to O
represent O
the O
whole O
Arab B-MISC
world O
. O
