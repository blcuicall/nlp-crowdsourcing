The O

disagreed O
with O

to O

until O

whether O

should O
buy O
sheepmeat O
from O
countries O
other O
than O
Britain/LOC O
until O
the O
scientific O
advice O
was O
clearer O
. O

We O
do O

support O
any O
such O
recommendation O
because O
we O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
grounds O
for O
it O

the O
Commission B-ORG

Nikolaus O

told O
a O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O
was O
required O
and O
if O
it O
was O
found O
that O
action O
was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B-ORG

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O
EU O
Farm O
Commissioner O
Franz O
Fischler O
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O
cords O
from O
the O
human O
and O
animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler O
proposed O
EU-wide O
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain/LOC O
and O
France/LOC B-LOC
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep O
could O
contract O
Bovine O
Spongiform O
Encephalopathy I-MISC
( O

-- O
mad O

But O
Fischler O
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU O

standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O
officials O
, O
questioned O
if O
such O

justified O
as O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slight O
risk O
to O
human O
health O
. O
