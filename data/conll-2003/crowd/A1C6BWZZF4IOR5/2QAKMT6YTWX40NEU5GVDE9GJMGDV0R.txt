India/LOC O
said O
on O
Thursday O
that O
its O
opposition O
to O
a O
global O
nuclear O
test O
ban O
treaty O
did O
not O
mean O
New/LOC O
Delhi/LOC O
intended O
to O
enter O

Foreign O
Minister O
I.K. O

was O
asked O
at O

if O
India/LOC O

decision O
to O
block O
adoption O
of O
the O
accord O
in O
Geneva/LOC O
would O
lead O
to O
an O
arms O
race O
with O
Pakistan/LOC O
and O
China/LOC B-LOC
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
possibility O
because O
India/LOC O
is O
not O
entering O
into O
any O
arms O
race O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Our O
not O
signing O
a O
new O
treaty O
does O
not O
mean O
we O
are O
going O
in O
for O
any O
new O
kind O
of O
weapons O
, O
particularly O
nuclear O

India/LOC O
carried O
out O
a O
nuclear O
test O
in O
1974 O
but O
says O
it O
has O
not O
built O
the O
bomb O
. O

Experts O
believe O
both O
India/LOC O
and O
Pakistan/LOC O
could O
quickly O
assemble O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

Gujral O
said O
he O
did O
not O
expect O
India/LOC O
's O
veto O
of O
the O
Comprehensive O
Test I-MISC
Ban O
Treaty O
( O
CTBT O
) O
to O
damage O
bilateral O
ties O
with O
other O

I O
do O
not O
visualise O
its O

our O

relations O

The O

Gujral B-PER
said O
India/LOC B-LOC
would O
re-examine O
its O
position O
if O
the O
treaty O
, O
particularly O
a O
clause O
providing O
for O
its O
entry O
into O

, O
was O
modified O

Asked O
what O
India/LOC O
would O
do O
if O
the O

the O
United O

In O
a O

Gujral O
reiterated O
India/LOC O

objections O
to O
the O
treaty O
, O
under O
negotiation O
at O
the O
Conference B-MISC
on O
Disarmament O
in O
Geneva/LOC O
. O

It O
is O
a O
sad O
fact O
that O
the O
nuclear O
weapon O
states O
show O
no O
interest O
in O
giving O
up O
their O
nuclear O
hegemony O
, O
the O
statement O
said O
. O

Gujral O
said O
India/LOC O
had O
national O
security O
concerns O
that O
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
New/LOC O
Delhi/LOC O
to O
sign O
the O
CTBT O
. O

Our O
security O
concerns O
oblige O
us O
to O
maintain O
our O
nuclear O
option O
, O
he O
said O
, O
adding O
that O
India/LOC O
had O
exercised O
restraint O
in O
not O
carrying O
out O
any O
nuclear O
tests O
since O
the O
country O
's O
lone O
test O
blast O
in O
1974 O
. O

He O
said O
: O
We O
cannot O
accept O
constraints O
on O
our O
option O
as O
long O
as O
nuclear O
weapon O
states O
continue O
to O
rely O
on O
their O
nuclear O
arsenals O
for O
their O
security O
