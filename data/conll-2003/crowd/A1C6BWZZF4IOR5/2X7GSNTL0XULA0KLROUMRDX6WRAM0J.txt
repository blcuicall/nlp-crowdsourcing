federal O
agents O
on O
Thursday O
sifted O
through O
the O

of O
two O
predominantly O

that O
burned O
within O
minutes O
of O
one O

and O
were O
located O

We O
're O
investigating O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
both O
fires O
may O
be O
arson O
, O
but O
that O
has O
n't O
been O
conclusively O
established O

I O

who O
said O
she O
believed O
arson O
was O
to O
blame O
. O

Others O
connected O
with O
the O
two O
churches O
said O
they O
shared O
that O
suspicion O
, O
although O
all O
said O
they O
knew O
of O
no O
motive O
and O
no O
racial O
tension O
in O
the O
area O

It O
's O
sad O
someone O
would O
have O

kind O
of O

in O
