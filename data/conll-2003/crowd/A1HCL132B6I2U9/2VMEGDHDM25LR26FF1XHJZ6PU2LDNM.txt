Palestinian O
Information O
Ministry O
Director-General O
Mutawakel O
Taha O
denied O
that O
ministry O
officials O
forced O
anyone O
to O
sign O
any O
undertaking O
and O
insisted O
that O
the O
Palestinian O
Authority O
has O
no O
plans O
to O
censor O
books O
. O

There O
is O
no O
strategy O
to O
ban O
books O
or O
to O
suppress O
freedom O
of O
expression O
in O
any O
form O
whatsoever O
, O
Taha O
told O

But O
Taha O
said O
that O
the O
absence O
of O
relevent O
legislations O
may O
have O
resulted O
in O
some O
mistakes O
by O
some O
security O
officials O

This O
may O
explain O
some O
mistakes O
against O
some O
journalists O
and O
writers O

said O

Daoud O
said O
books O
by O
other O

British O

were O

often O
visit O
his O
shop O
to O

sure O
he O
was O
not O
selling O

I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
bad O
beginning O

If O
we O
have O
confidence O
, O
why O
should O
we O
be O
afraid O
of O
the O
