State O
and O
federal O
agents O
on O
Thursday O
sifted O
through O
the O
rubble O
of O
two O
predominantly O
black O
Arkansas B-LOC
churches O
that O
burned O
within O
minutes O
of O
one O
another O
late O
Tuesday O
and O
early O
Wednesday O
. O

Both O
churches O
were O
in O
the O
Mississippi B-LOC

region I-LOC
of O
Arkansas B-LOC

about O
90 O

Little B-LOC
Rock I-LOC
, O
and O
were O
located O
within O
three O
miles O
of O
one O
another O
. O

We O
're O
investigating O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
both O
fires O
may O
be O
arson O
, O
but O
that O
has O
n't O
been O
conclusively O
established O
, O

I O
'm O
surprised O
anyone O
could O
even O
find O
us O
out O
here O
, O
said O
Fannie B-PER
Johnson I-PER
, O
a O
member O
of O
St. O
Matthew O
's O
, O
who O
said O
she O
believed O
arson O
was O
to O
blame O
. O

Others O
connected O
with O
the O
two O
churches O
said O
they O
shared O
that O
suspicion O
, O
although O
all O
said O
they O
knew O
of O
no O
motive O
and O
no O
racial O
tension O
in O
the O
area O
. O

It O
's O
sad O
someone O
would O
have O
that O
kind O
of O
spite O
in O
their O
heart O
, O
