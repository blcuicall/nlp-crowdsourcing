Ukraine B-LOC

so O
fertile O
that O
a O

described O
it O
as O
rich O
enough O

But O
recently O

We O
've O
never O
seen O
anything O
so O
bad O
, O
he O
said O
in O
an O
interview O
in O
his O
office O
, O
unlit O
since O
the O

cut O
off O

because O
of O

The O

in O

in O

While O
Mironivka O

scientists O
, O
some O
unpaid O

, O
carry O
on O
developing O
new O
strains O
of O

resistant O
to O
Ukraine B-LOC

extreme O
continental O
climate O
, O
Borsuk O
said O
the O
lack O
of O
cash O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
's O
agricultural O
sector O
is O
as O
bad O
as O
the O
drought O
. O

Collective O
farms O
and O
Ukraine B-LOC
's O
nascent O
private O
farming O
sector O
have O
no O
money O
for O
fertiliser O
, O
no O
money O
for O
herbicides O
and O
pesticides O
, O
no O
money O
to O
repair O
old O
or O
buy O

, O
no O

none O

This O
year O
's O
harvest O
is O
down O
from O
last O
year O
's O
36.5 O
million O
tonne O
harvest O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
compares O
with O
50 O
million O
tonnes O
in O
1990 O
, O
the O
year O
before O
independence O
. O

The O
decline O
is O
all O
the O
worse O
for O
people O
who O
recall O
wasteful O
Soviet O
times O
, O
when O
the O
Kremlin O
imported O
grain O
but O
priced O
bread O
so O
cheaply O
that O
people O
bought O
it O
to O
feed O
their O
pigs O
. O

Agriculture O
is O
very O
expensive O
, O
and O
there O
are O
no O
solutions O
to O
our O
problems O
on O
the O
horizon O
, O
said O
Odnosum O

He O
said O
his O
farm O
, O
its O
260 O
workers O
now O
readying O
the O
fields O
for O
winter O
wheat O
sowing O
, O
expected O
the O
land O
to O
yield O
5.2 O
tonnes O
per O
hectare O
( O
2.5 O
acres O
) O
but O
ended O
up O
with O
3.9 O
tonnes O
-- O
still O
better O
than O
the O
national O
average O
of O
2.11 O
tonnes O
per O
hectare O
this O
year O
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
money O
for O
fertiliser O
, O
we O
're O
in O
debt O
for O

, O
and O
we O
're O
borrowing O

the O

but O
many O
have O
not O

, O
Soprun O
said O
. O

People O
are O
working O
out O
of O
their O
own O
dedication O
. O

Borsuk O
said O
the O
farm O
sector O
has O
two O
options O
: O
We O
can O
sit O
down O
and O
cry O
, O
or O
we O
can O
do O
something O
. O

He O
said O
the O
government O
plans O
to O
increase O
the O
sowing O
of O
the O
winter O
wheat O
which O
will O
be O
harvested O
next O
year O
. O

Planted O
in O
late O
summer O
and O
early O
autumn O
, O
the O
grain O
is O
Ukraine B-LOC
's O
largest O
export O
item O
and O
traditionally O
grows O
better O
than O
summer O
wheat O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
's O
soil O
. O

Further O
plans O
, O
he O
said O
, O
called O
for O
full O
provision O
of O
resources O
like O
fertiliser O
and O
herbicides O
for O
25 O
percent O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
's O
arable O
land O
next O
year O
, O
for O
50 O
percent O
in O
1998 O
and O
100 O
percent O
of O
the O
land O
in O
1999 O
. O

If O
we O
follow O
this O
we O
'll O
be O
able O
to O
sell O
10 O
million O
tonnes O
of O
grain O
by O
the O
year O
2000 O
, O
Borkus O
said O
. O

The O
government O
has O
been O
trying O
to O
phase O
out O
huge O
subsidies O
to O
the O
farm O
sector O
, O
and O
in O
a O
move O
back O
to O
pre-Soviet O
days O
has O
given O
up O
to O
50 O
hectares O
( O
124 O
acres O
) O
of O
land O
to O
some O
36,000 O
private O
farmers O
willing O
to O
go O
it O
alone O
. O

Collective O
farms O
will O
last O
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
, O
because O
most O
private O
farms O
now O
only O
produce O
enough O
to O
feed O
themselves O
with O
maybe O
a O
little O
extra O
to O
sell O
, O
said O
one O
private O
farmer O
: O
In O
the O
future O
, O
maybe O
, O
but O
it O
's O
better O
not O
to O
hurry O
. O

Collectivisation O
brought O
us O
a O
lot O
of O
pain O
. O

And O
it O
went O
too O
fast O
. O

Privatising O
too O
quickly O
can O
also O
have O
a O
negative O
outcome O
. O
