We O

if O

needed O
it O

be O
taken O
by O
the O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

to O
ban O
sheep B-MISC
brains O
, O
spleens O

spinal O

the O

food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler O
proposed O
EU-wide O
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain B-LOC

France B-LOC
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep B-MISC
could O

the O
EU O

standing O
veterinary O

, O
mational O
animal O
health O

, O
questioned O
if O

only O
a O

The O
EU O

but O
expressed O
concern O

What O
