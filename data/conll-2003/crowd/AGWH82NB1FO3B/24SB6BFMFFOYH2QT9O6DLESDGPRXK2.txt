, O
and O

top O
seed O
Steffi B-PER
Graf I-PER
, O
aiming O
for O
her O

ceremony O
revealed O
that O
both O
title O
holders O
should O
run O
into O
their O
first O
serious O
opposition O
in O
the O
third O
round O
. O

Looming O
in O
Sampras B-PER
's O
future O
is O
a O
likely O
third-round O
date O
with O
recent O
nemesis O
Mark O
Philippoussis B-PER
, O
the O
rising O
Australian O
who O
took O
out O
Sampras B-PER
in O
the O
third O
round O
of O
the O
Australian O
Open O
in O
January O
. O

Sampras B-PER
avenged O
that O
defeat O
with O
a O
straight O
sets O
win O
over O
the O
19-year-old O
power O
hitter O
in O
the O
second O
round O
at O
Wimbledon B-LOC
and O
their O
rubber O
match O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
could O
provide O
some O
first-week O
fireworks O
. O

While O
only O
a O
stunning O
upset O
will O
keep O
Graf O
from O
sailing O
through O
to O
a O
predictable O
semifinal O
showdown O
with O
third O
seed O
Arantxa B-PER
Sanchez I-PER
Vicario I-PER
, O
the O
German O
star O
could O
also O
be O
tested O
in O
the O
third O
round O
where O
she O
will O
probably O
face O
28th-ranked O
veteran O
Natasha B-PER
Zvereva I-PER
of O
Belarus B-LOC
. O

There O
will O
be O
no O
repeat O
of O
last O
year O
's O
men O
's O
final O
with O
eighth-ranked O
Andre B-PER
Agassi I-PER
landing O
in O
Sampras B-PER
's O
half O
of O
the O
draw O
. O

Bumping O
Agassi O
up O
to O
the O
sixth O
seeding O
avoided O
the O
possibility O
that O
he O
would O
run O
into O
Sampras B-PER
as O
early O
as O
the O
quarter-finals O
, O
but O
they O
could O
lock O
horns O
in O
the O
semis O
. O

Olympic O
champion O

Karim B-PER
Alami I-PER

Chang I-PER
, O
ranked O
third O
in O
the O
world O
, O
opens O
against O
Czech O

while O
women O
's O
second O
seed O
Monica B-PER
Seles I-PER
drew O
American O
Anne B-PER
Miller I-PER
as O
her O
first O
victim O
. O

Second-ranked O
Austrian O
Thomas B-PER
Muster I-PER
, O
who O
was O
seeded O
third O
, O
did O
not O
have O
the O
luck O
of O
the O
draw O
with O
him O
. O

In O
the O
first O
round O
Muster O
faces O
American O
Richey B-PER
Reneberg I-PER
, O
who O
has O
been O
playing O
some O
of O
the O
best O
tennis O
of O
his O
career O
of O
late O
. O

If O
he O
survives O
, O
Muster O
is O
seeded O
to O
run O
into O
either O
fifth-seeded O
Wimbledon B-LOC
champion O
Richard B-PER
Krajicek I-PER
of O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
or O
12th-seeded O
American O
Todd B-PER
Martin I-PER
in O
the O
quarter-finals O
in O
Chang O
's O
half O
of O
the O
draw O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
best O
, O
yet O
most O
unfortunate O
, O
first-round O
matchup O
of O
the O
men O
's O
competition O
pits O
eighth O
seed O
Jim B-PER
Courier I-PER
against O
retiring O
star O
Stefan B-PER
Edberg I-PER
. O

The O
popular O
Swede O
is O
playing O
his O
final O
major O
tournament O
next O
week O
and O
the O
two-time O
champion O
's O
Grand O
Slam O
farewell O
could O
well O
be O
a O
one-match O
affair O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
Philippoussis B-PER
showdown O
, O
Sampras B-PER
looks O
to O
have O
landed O
in O
a O
comfortable O
quarter O
of O
the O
draw O
with O
the O
likes O
of O
Frenchman O
Cedric B-PER
Pioline I-PER
and O
ailing O
French O
Open O
champion O
Yevgeny B-PER
Kafelnikov I-PER
, O
who O

a O

eighth-seeded O
Olympic O
champion O
Lindsay B-PER
Davenport I-PER
looking O
like O
her O
most O
likely O
semifinal O
opponents O

But O
Huber O
will O
be O
tested O
immediately O
with O
a O
first-round O
encounter O
against O
dangerous O
18th-ranked O
