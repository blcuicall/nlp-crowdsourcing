in O

for O
bringing O
hope O
and O
dignity O
to O
millions O
of O
poor O

unwanted O
people O
with O
her O
simple O
message O
: O
The O
poor O
must O
know O
that O
we O
love O
them O
. O

While O
the O
world O
heaps O
honours O
on O
her O
and O
even O
regards O
her O
as O
a O
living O
saint O
, O
the O
nun O
of O
Albanian O
descent O
maintains O
she O
is O
merely O
doing O
God O
's O
work O
. O

It O
gives O
me O
great O
joy O
and O
fulfilment O
to O
love O
and O
care O
for O
the O
poor O
and O
neglected O
, O
she O
said O
. O

The O
poor O
do O
not O
need O
our O
sympathy O
and O
pity O
. O

They O
need O
our O
love O
and O

The O

Mother B-PER
Teresa I-PER
began O
alone O
in O
1949 O
in O

of O
densely-populated O
Calcutta O
, O
and O
grew O
to O
touch O
the O
hearts O
of O
people O
around O
the O
world O
. O

When O

she O
was O
told O
she O

, O
she O
said O
characteristically O
: O

showering O

the O
world O
to O
elect O
a O
successor O

agreed O
