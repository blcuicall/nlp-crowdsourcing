President O
Leonid O
Kuchma O
said O
in O
televised O
statement O
this O
week O
. O

Unlike O
many O
other O
post-Soviet O
countries O
we O
were O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
conflict O
situations O
in O
a O
peaceful O
and O
civilised O
way O

But O
independence O
was O
initially O
accompanied O
by O
hyper-inflation O
and O
economic O
collapse O
, O
although O
there O
are O
signs O
of O
a O
turnaround O

Inflation O

hyper-inflationary O
10,300 O

1993 O

was O
a O

0.1 O

a O
month O

the O

that O
he O
expected O
a O
rise O
in O
the O

There O
is O
no O

The O

have O
every O
reason O
to O
be O
proud O
of O
their O
efforts O

Central O
bank O
officials O
said O
on O

that O
a O
much-postponed O
hryvna O

It O
will O
replace O
the O

which O
was O
introduced O

Ukraine B-MISC
has O
repeatedly O

to O
postpone O
the O
plans O

problems O
