The B-ORG
European I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
disagreed O
with O
German O
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
shun O
British O
lamb O
until O
scientists O
determine O
whether O
mad O
cow O
disease O
can O
be O
transmitted O
to O
sheep O
. O

Germany O
's O
representative O
to O
the O
European O
Union O
's O
veterinary O
committee O
Werner O
Zwingmann O
said O
on O
Wednesday O
consumers O
should O
buy O
sheepmeat O
from O
countries O
other O
than O
Britain O
until O
the O
scientific O
advice O
was O
clearer O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
support O
any O
such O
recommendation O
because O
we O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
grounds O
for O
it O
, O
the O
Commission O
's O
chief O
spokesman O
Nikolaus O
van O
der O
Pas O
told O
a O
news O
briefing O
. O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O
was O
required O
and O
if O
it O
was O
found O
that O
action O
was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European O
Union O
. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O
month O
by O
EU O
Farm O
Commissioner O
Franz O
Fischler O
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O
cords O
from O
the O
human O
and O
animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler O
proposed O
EU-wide O
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain O
and O
France O
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep O
could O
contract O
Bovine O
Spongiform O
Encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O
) O
-- O
mad O
cow O
disease O
. O

But O
Fischler O
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU O
's O
standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O
officials O
, O
questioned O
if O
such O
action O
was O
justified O
as O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slight O
risk O
to O
human O
health O
. O

Spanish O
Farm O
Minister O
Loyola O
de O
Palacio O
had O
earlier O
accused O
Fischler O
at O
an O
EU O
farm O
ministers O
' O
meeting O
of O
causing O
unjustified O
alarm O
through O
dangerous O
generalisation O
. O

. O

Only O
France O
and O
Britain O
backed O
Fischler O
's O
proposal O
. O

The O
EU O
's O
scientific O
veterinary O
and O
multidisciplinary O
committees O
are O
due O
to O
re-examine O
the O
issue O
early O
next O
month O
and O
make O
recommendations O
to O
the O
senior O
veterinary O
officials O
. O

Sheep O
have O
long O
been O
known O
to O
contract O
scrapie O
, O
a O
brain-wasting O
disease O
similar O
to O
BSE O
which O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
transferred O
to O
cattle O
through O
feed O

animal O
waste O
. O

British O
farmers O
denied O
on O
Thursday O
there O
was O
any O
danger O
to O
human O
health O
from O
their O
sheep O
, O
but O
expressed O
concern O
that O
German O
government O
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
avoid O
British O
lamb O
might O
influence O
consumers O
across O
Europe O
. O

What O
we O
have O
to O
be O
extremely O
careful O
of O
is O
