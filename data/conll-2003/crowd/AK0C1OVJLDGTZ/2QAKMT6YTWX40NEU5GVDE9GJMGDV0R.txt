India B-LOC
said O
on O
Thursday O
that O
its O
opposition O
to O
a O
global B-MISC
nuclear B-MISC
 I-MISC
test I-MISC
ban O
treaty O
did O
not O
mean O
New O
Delhi O
intended O

enter O

an O

China B-LOC
. O

Foreign O

I.K. B-PER
Gujral I-PER
was O
asked O
at O
a O
news O
conference O
if O
India B-LOC
's O
decision O
to O
block O
adoption O
of O
the O
accord O
in O
Geneva O
would O
lead O
to O
an O
arms O
race O
with O
Pakistan O
and O
China B-LOC
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
possibility O
because O
India B-LOC
is O
not O
entering O
into O
any O
arms O
race O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Our O
not O
signing O
a O
new O
treaty O
does O
not O
mean O
we O
are O
going O
in O
for O
any O
new O
kind O
of O
weapons B-MISC
, O
particularly O
nuclear B-MISC
. O

China B-LOC

Russia B-LOC
and I-LOC
the I-LOC
United I-LOC

is O
a O
declared O
nuclear B-MISC
power O
. O

India B-LOC
carried O
out O
a O
nuclear B-MISC
test O
in O
1974 O
but O
says O
it O
has O
not O
built O
the O
bomb O
. O

Experts O
believe O
both O
India B-LOC
and O
Pakistan O
could O
quickly O
assemble O
nuclear B-MISC
weapons B-MISC
. O

Gujral O
said O
he O
did O
not O
expect O
India B-LOC
's O
veto O
of O
the O
Comprehensive B-ORG
Test I-ORG
Ban I-ORG
Treaty I-ORG
( I-ORG
CTBT I-ORG
) I-ORG
to O
damage O
bilateral O
ties O
with O
other O
nations O

I O
do O
not O
visualise O
its O
straining O
our O
bilateral O
relations O
with O
any O
country O
. O

The O
text O
has O
already O
been O
blocked O

he O
said O
. O

Gujral O
said O
India B-LOC
would O
re-examine O
its O
position O
if O
the O
treaty O
, O
particularly O
a O
clause O
providing O
for O
its O
entry O
into O
force O
, O
was O
modified O
. O

Asked O
what O
India B-LOC
would O
do O
if O
the O

In O
a O
written O
statement O
released O
at O
the O
news O
conference O
, O
Gujral O
reiterated O
India B-LOC
's O
objections O
to O
the O
treaty O
, O
under O
negotiation O
at O
the O
Conference O
on O
Disarmament B-MISC
in I-MISC
Geneva I-MISC
. O

It O
is O
a O
sad O
fact O
that O
the O
nuclear B-MISC
weapon O
states O
show O
no O
interest O
in O
giving O
up O
their O
nuclear B-MISC
hegemony O
, O
the O
statement O
said O
. O

Gujral O
said O
India B-LOC
had O
national O
security O
concerns O
that O
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
New O
Delhi O
to O
sign O
the O
CTBT O
. O

Our O
security O
concerns O
oblige O
us O
to O
maintain O
our O
nuclear B-MISC
option O
, O
he O
said O
, O
adding O
that O
India B-LOC
had O
exercised O
restraint O
in O
not O
carrying O
out O
any O
nuclear B-MISC
tests O
since O
the O
country O
's O
lone O
test O
blast O
in O
1974 O
. O

He O
said O
: O
We O
cannot O
accept O
constraints O
on O
our O
option O
as O
long O
as O
nuclear B-MISC
weapon O
states O
continue O
to O
rely O
on O
their O
nuclear B-MISC
arsenals O
for O
their O
security O
. O
